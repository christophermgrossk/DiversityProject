# DiversityCapstoneProject

libraries that are used in this project include:

firebase
react-navigation

commands to install 
npm install --save firebase
npm install --save react-navigation

Things that still need to be done:

Styling the welcoming screen with all the tab options as well as putting in the features for all the other screens (news, education, the events, and stories)

1.News will be grabbed from News API to receive current news with a refresh screen to get kinda constant updates

2.Events will be kinda like a TODO List but instead will be adding events directly from the slide out screen

3.Stories will be done more or less the same way... I think

4.Education will just it's own screen with it's respective topics on each committees issues. Probably designed in a way with cards so each committee's agenda is opened up.

There's no order in which these have to be done

Styling can be done whenever, whether it be while making the screen or whenever after it.
Comments still need to get added too so everyone knows what is going on.
