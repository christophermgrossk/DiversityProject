libraries that are used in this project include:

firebase
react-navigation

commands to install 
npm install --save firebase
npm install --save react-navigation

Things that still need to be done:

Styling the welcoming screen with all the tab options as well as putting in the features for all the other screens (news, education, the events, and stories)

1. News will be grabbed from News API to receive current news with a refresh screen to get kinda constant updates (this is done)

2. Events will be kinda like a TODO List but instead will be adding events directly from the slide out screen (this what i'm currently working on so if anyone wants to chime in and help. I eventually want a button in the bottom right hand corner that'll bring up some text inputs that'll get transferred to a card view)

Edit to events screen: This is all outta wack. I'm trying to see if I can get information for the database that presence uses from Lewis but Student Activities doesn't know what I am asking for so I'm trying another way but that other way isn't working all too well either. We may or may not be able to do this.

3. Stories will be done more or less the same way... I think, this I believe may not be as awful? I won't necessarily be able to do this one yet because I have to get the information from the 3 people that have volunteered to give their story.

4. Education will just it's own screen with it's respective topics on each committees issues. Probably designed in a way with cards so each committee's agenda is opened up. I think this will just be a section with a drop down menu to show the educations

5. We still need to get the world map thing that Ryan brought up. The Dr. Kelly really liked this feature and she wanted us to put this in.


There's no order in which these have to be done

Styling can be done whenever, whether it be while making the screen or whenever after it.
Comments still need to get added too so everyone knows what is going on.
